Objective : Predicting the microstructure of high entropy alloys (HEAs). These alloys have the potential to have really great properties, like being really strong or resistant to corrosion. We're trying to figure out what makes these alloys have certain properties by looking at different factors like the size of the atoms in the alloy, how much disorder there is in the mixing of the atoms, and how much energy is involved in mixing them together. The goal is to use all this information to create a model that can predict what phases(microstructure) an alloy will have based on its composition. This will help us design new alloys with specific properties in mind.
